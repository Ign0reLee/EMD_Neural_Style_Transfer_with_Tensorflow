## How to use it
We are still in training, so we can not tell you whether it is complete.
If you just want to do it, follow these steps:

### Download Data 

Follow the Links and download Ms coco dataset and Kaggle Dataset. and place it in the './Data' folder according to the rules

If you want to change the data location format, modify the code in train.py

### Download VGG

Follow the Link and clone the VGG tensorflow code, and tested it!

### Run train.py

If you do all, Move to your path, and Enter the python train.py
